This is an implementation of an enhanced access control log.

Due to a problem i cant find, always delete the file_logging.log before executing.
Do not delete the key files, because they are vital for the program.

Due to lack of time i couldnt make a proper test_acm file. You can test acmonitor by
manually changing the log file, producing malicious users.

Encryption and decryption from rsa_assign are used here.
